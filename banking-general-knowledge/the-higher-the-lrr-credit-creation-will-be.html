The money multiplier is a phenomenon that occurs in the economy when money is created in the form of credit.

From the above calculation, we can conclude that higher the reserve Ratio, lesser credit will be created by Commercial Banks in the economy.An increase in CRR, would mean that banks would be required to keep a greater portion in form of deposits with the central bank.
