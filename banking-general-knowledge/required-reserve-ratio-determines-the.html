<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The bankâ€™s reserve requirement ratio determines how much money is available to loan out and therefore the amount of these created deposits. The deposit multiplier is then the ratio of the amount of the checkable deposits to the reserve amount. The deposit multiplier is the inverse of the reserve requirement ratio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An increase in the reserve ratio will decrease the size of the monetary multiplier and decrease the excess reserves held by commercial banks, thus causing the money supply to decrease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A one-dollar increase in the monetary base causes the money supply to increase by more than one dollar. The increase in the money supply is the money multiplier. Money is either currency held by the public or bank deposits: M =C+D.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The required reserve ratio gives the percent of deposits that banks must hold as reserves. It is the ratio of required reserves to deposits. If the required reserve ratio is 10 percent this means that banks must hold 10 percent of their deposits as required reserves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Money multiplier = 1 / R, where R is the reserve ratio A money multiplier of 20 means that the bank has 20 times as much in deposits as it does in reserves. Each dollar of reserves will theoretically generate $20 of money.
