</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Share: When someone pays you with a check, typically you have to sign the back of it before you can deposit it in your account. Signing the back of it is called “endorsing the check.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Blank endorsement of a financial instrument, such as a cheque, is only a signature, not indicating the payee. The effect of this is that it is payable only to the bearer – legally, it transforms an order instrument ("pay to the order of (the payee)") into a bearer instrument ("pay to the bearer").
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If the indorsement is made by a holder and is not a special indorsement, it is a blank indorsement.
