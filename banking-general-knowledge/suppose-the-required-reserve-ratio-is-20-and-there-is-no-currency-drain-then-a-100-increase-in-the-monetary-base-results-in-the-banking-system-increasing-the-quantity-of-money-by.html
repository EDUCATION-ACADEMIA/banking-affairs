<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The simple money multiplier for a 20% required reserve ratio is 5. (The reciprocal of the required reserve ratio.) When that 5 is multiplied by the $800 of excess reserves available for lending the result is $4, 000 of money added to the initial $1, 000 deposit for a total potential money creation of $5, 000.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If the Fed sells $10 million in bonds to a bank, and the required reserve ratio is 20 percent, then the banking system can: decrease the money supply by up to $50 million.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What happens to the money multiplier when the reserve requirement increases from 20% to 25%? It decreases from 5 to 4.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A reduction in the required reserve ratio from 20% to 10% is an expansionary monetary policy because it implies that the banks are required to keep a lower proportion of the total deposits in the form of reserves, freeing up money to be given out as loans for credit creation.
