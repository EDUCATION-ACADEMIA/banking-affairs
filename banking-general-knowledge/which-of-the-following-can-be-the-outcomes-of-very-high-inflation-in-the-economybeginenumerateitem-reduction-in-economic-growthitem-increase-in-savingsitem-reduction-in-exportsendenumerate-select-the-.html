<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Erodes Purchasing Power An overall rise in prices over time reduces the purchasing power of consumers, since a fixed amount of money will afford progressively less consumption. Consumers lose purchasing power whether inflation is running at 2% or at 4%; they just lose it twice as fast at the higher rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A higher inflation target could increase uncertainty and costs in the economy. A lower inflation target, on the other hand, is costly to achieve. For example: The reduction in growth in spending and investment required to keep inflation at a lower target would lower output growth and increase unemployment.
