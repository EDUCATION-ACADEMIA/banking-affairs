An asset is classified as a sub-standard asset if it remains as an NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months. An asset is classified as a doubtful asset if it remained as an NPA for more than 12 months.In any case, delay beyond six months is not considered desirable as a general discipline. Hence, an account where the regular/ ad hoc credit limits have not been reviewed/ renewed within 180 days from the due date/ date of ad hoc sanction will be treated as NPA.The banking sector follows an automated system for tagging accounts as NPAs, under which the accounts are tagged as NPAs on the day the account becomes overdue for more than 90 days.
