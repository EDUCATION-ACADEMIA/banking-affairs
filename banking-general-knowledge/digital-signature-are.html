<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is an electronic signature that ensures that an electronic document is authentic. A digital signature is not a record rather it provides authentication of the record. A digital certificate is an electronic record that identifies the certifying authority issuing it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A digital signature is one form of electronic signature that is like an electronic “fingerprint.” It offers additional verification of the identities of individuals signing documents by providing an encrypted stamp of authentication and digital ID to confirm information originated from them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Using a public key algorithm, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), two keys are generated, creating a mathematically linked pair of keys, one private and one public.
