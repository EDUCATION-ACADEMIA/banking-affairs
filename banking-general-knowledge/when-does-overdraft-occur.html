Examples are overdrafts caused by check, in-person withdrawal, debit card purchase, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means.An overdraft happens when you dont have enough money available to cover a purchase or a payment. Another way of saying this is an overdraft happens when a transaction exceeds your available balance. When this happens, well either pay it for you, overdrawing your account, or well decline it or return it unpaid.You agree a limit with your bank and can spend money up to that limit. Unauthorised overdrafts: these are also known as unplanned or unarranged overdrafts and happen when you spend more than you have in your bank account without agreeing it in advance. This includes going over the limit of an authorised overdraft.It is possible to withdraw funds beyond the account balance, but they are subject to repercussions, bank terms, and fees.
