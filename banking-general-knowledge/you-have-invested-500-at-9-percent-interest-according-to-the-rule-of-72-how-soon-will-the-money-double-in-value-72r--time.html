For example, the Rule of 72 states that $1 invested at an annual fixed interest rate of 10% would take 7.2 years ((72/10) = 7.2) to grow to $2. In reality, a 10% investment will take 7.3 years to double ((1.107.3 = 2). The Rule of 72 is reasonably accurate for low rates of return.A borrower who pays 12% interest on their credit card (or any other form of loan that is charging compound interest) will double the amount they owe in six years. The rule can also be used to find the amount of time it takes for moneys value to halve due to inflation.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Do you know the Rule of 72? It’s an easy way to calculate just how long it’s going to take for your money to double. Just take the number 72 and divide it by the interest rate you hope to earn. That number gives you the approximate number of years it will take for your investment to double.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-For example, with a 9% rate of return, the simple calculation returns a time to double of eight years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-How the Rule of 72 Works. For example, the Rule of 72 states that $1 invested at an annual fixed interest rate of 10% would take 7.2 years ((72/10) = 7.2) to grow to $2. In reality, a 10% investment will take 7.3 years to double ((1.107.3 = 2). The Rule of 72 is reasonably accurate for low rates of return.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A borrower who pays 12% interest on their credit card (or any other form of loan that is charging compound interest) will double the amount they owe in six years. The rule can also be used to find the amount of time it takes for money’s value to halve due to inflation.
