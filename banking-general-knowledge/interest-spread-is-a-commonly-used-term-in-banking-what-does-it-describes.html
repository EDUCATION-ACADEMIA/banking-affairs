The terms and conditions attached to these rates differ by country, however, limiting their comparability.Net interest rate spread refers to the difference between the interest rate a financial institution pays to depositors and the interest rate it receives from loans. In other words, it is the difference between the borrowing and lending interest rates of the bank.Interest rates on consumer loans are typically quoted as the annual percentage rate (APR). This is the rate of return that lenders demand for the ability to borrow their money. For example, the interest rate on credit cards is quoted as an APR. In our example above, 4% is the APR for the mortgage or borrower.Periodic rate is the rate charged by a lender each period. It can be quoted as a rate per period, say semiannually, per quarter or per month. For example, a bank could charge 1% per month for a credit card loan.">
