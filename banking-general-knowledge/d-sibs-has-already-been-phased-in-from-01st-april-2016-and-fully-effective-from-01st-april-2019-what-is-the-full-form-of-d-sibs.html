The Reserve Bank of India on Monday said that the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs).A D-SIB is a bank that is considered to be so important to the financial system that its failure could cause significant disruption. As a result, these banks are required to maintain higher capital buffers to protect against potential losses and ensure their stability.The Reserve Bank had announced SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016. Based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2017, HDFC Bank was also classified as a D-SIB, along with SBI and ICICI Bank. The current update is based on the data collected from banks as on March 31, 2022.Essentially, systemically important banks are the ones perceived as too big to fail.
