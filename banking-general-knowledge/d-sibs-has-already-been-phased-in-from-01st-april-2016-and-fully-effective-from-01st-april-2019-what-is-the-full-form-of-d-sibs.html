The Reserve Bank of India on Monday said that the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs).A D-SIB is a bank that is considered to be so important to the financial system that its failure could cause significant disruption. As a result, these banks are required to maintain higher capital buffers to protect against potential losses and ensure their stability.The Reserve Bank had announced SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016.
