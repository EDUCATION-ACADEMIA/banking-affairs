<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Blood group O is common, and individuals with this blood type will have both anti-A and anti-B in their serum. Blood group AB is the least common, and these individuals will have neither anti-A nor anti-B in their serum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The need for O+ is high because it is the most frequently occurring blood type (37% of the population). The universal red cell donor has Type O negative blood. The universal plasma donor has Type AB blood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The O allele is the most common ABO allele around the world, and type O blood is the most common ABO blood type. Almost two-thirds of people have at least one copy of the O allele.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Common Kell phenotypes The k antigen is more common than the K antigen in most populations, the K-k+ phenotype is found in 98% of Blacks and 91% of Caucasians (2).
