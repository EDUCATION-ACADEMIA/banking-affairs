To evaluate capacity, or your ability to repay a loan, lenders look at revenue, expenses, cash flow and repayment timing in your business plan. They also look at your business and personal credit reports, as well as credit scores from credit bureaus such as Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.Called the five Cs of credit, they include capacity, capital, conditions, character, and collateral. There is no regulatory standard that requires the use of the five Cs of credit, but the majority of lenders review most of this information prior to allowing a borrower to take on debt.In the 5 Cs of credit, capital refers to your financial ability to meet credit obligations.

In the 5 Cs of credit, conditions refers to general economic conditions that can affect your ability to repay a loan.The 5 Cs are Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions.
