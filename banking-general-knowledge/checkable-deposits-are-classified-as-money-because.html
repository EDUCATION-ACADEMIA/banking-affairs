<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Checkable deposits are money because their owners can write checks against them. Federal Reserve Notes are liabilities of the Federal Reserve. (Printed by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.) They can only be exchanged for more currency, so they are fiat money.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable deposits that are money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you.
