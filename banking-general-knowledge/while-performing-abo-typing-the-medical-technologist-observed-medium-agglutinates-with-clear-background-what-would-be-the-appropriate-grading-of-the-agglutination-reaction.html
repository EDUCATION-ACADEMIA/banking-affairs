<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The process of agglutination involves two steps. First step is sensitization and second is lattice formation. It is attachment of specific antibody to corresponding antigen. pH, temperature and time of incubation influence the reaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Agglutination is the central reaction in blood banking, as most of our testing for decades has relied on its detection. The agglutinates are typically characterized on a 0-4+ scale, with 0 representing no reaction, and 4+ indicating a very strong reaction (see images above).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-1+ agglutination: Red blood cell button breaks into many small clumps barely visible macroscopically; the background is turbid; many free red blood cells. Negative: No agglutinated red blood cells present; red cells are observed flowing off the red blood cell button during the process of grading.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All tube tests are graded (e.g., 4+, 3+, 2+, 1+, -) where 4+ is one solid clump of red cells and 1+ is the presence of many small clumps (agglutinates).
