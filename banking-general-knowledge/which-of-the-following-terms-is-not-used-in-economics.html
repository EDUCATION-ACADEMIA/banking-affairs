<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Centrifugal force is mainly used in the field of physics and hence it is not used in Economics.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This empirical relation, formulated by the physicist Robert Boyle in 1662, states that the pressure (p) of a given quantity of gas varies inversely with its volume (v) at constant temperature; i.e., in equation form, pv = k, a constant. The relationship was also discovered by the French physicist Edme Mariotte (1676).

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If we now come to option D, the graph in it states that the product of pressure and volume is not constant. If we look at the graph it is looking like a product of pressure and volume is decreasing with increasing pressure. This is not Boyle’s law.
