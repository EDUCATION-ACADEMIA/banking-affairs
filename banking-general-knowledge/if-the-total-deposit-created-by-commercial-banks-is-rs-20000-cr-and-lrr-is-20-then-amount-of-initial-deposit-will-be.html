<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The initial deposits of ₹10, 000 have been made into the bank, and the banks are required to maintain 20% of the deposits with them as the LRR is 20%, therefore the bank has to maintain 20% of ₹10, 000 i.e. ₹2, 000 with itself and can lend the rest of the money i.e. ₹8, 000 as loans to the public.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Money Multiplier = 10.2=5 1 0.2 = 5 where reserve ratio is 20 percent or 0.2. 2.
