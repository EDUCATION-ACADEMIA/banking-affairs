This is because even though the two accounts have the same rate of interest, the frequency of the 5% interest compounded daily account is higher.By definition, a bank that pays simple interest on a savings account will pay interest: only on the initial investment. Compound interest is defined as the interest earned: on both the initial principal and all interest earned and reinvested in prior periods.Multiply your principal by the interest rate, and then the amount of time you expect to keep that money in the account.
