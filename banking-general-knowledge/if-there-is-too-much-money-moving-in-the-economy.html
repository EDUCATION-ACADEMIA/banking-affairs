<meta name="description" content="Long-lasting episodes of high inflation are often the result of lax monetary policy. If the money supply grows too big relative to the size of an economy, the unit value of the currency diminishes; in other words, its purchasing power falls and prices rise.So what causes inflation? Inflation is caused when the money supply in an economy grows at faster rate than the economys ability to produce goods and services. In our auction economy the production of goods and services was unchanged, but the money supply grew from round one to round two.More jobs and higher wages increase household incomes and lead to a rise in consumer spending, further increasing aggregate demand and the scope for firms to increase the prices of their goods and services. When this happens across a large number of businesses and sectors, this leads to an increase in inflation.Increase in public spending, hoarding, tax reductions, price rise in international markets are the causes of inflation. These factors lead to rising prices. Also, increasing demands causes higher prices which leads to Inflation.">
