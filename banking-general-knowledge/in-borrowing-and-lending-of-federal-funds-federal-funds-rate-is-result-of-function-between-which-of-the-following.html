<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) sets the federal funds rate-also known as the federal funds target rate or the fed funds rate-to guide overnight lending among U.S. banks. Itâ€™s set as a range between an upper and lower limit. The federal funds rate is currently 4.50% to 4.75%.
