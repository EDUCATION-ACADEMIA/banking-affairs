<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Factoring is not considered a loan, as the parties neither issue nor acquire debt as part of the transaction. The funds provided to the company in exchange for the accounts receivable are also not subject to any restrictions regarding use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A regular bank loan requires taking on debt and has a strict timeline on when you need to pay back the borrowed money. When it comes to factoring, the factoring company pays you up front for your invoices (at a discount) so you’re getting paid for what is already owed to you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Definition: Factoring is a type of finance in which a business would sell its accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Under the transaction between both parties, the factor would pay the amount due on the invoices minus its commission or fees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The factor also examines your accounts receivables and is normally more lenient on the ones they accept, but they will typically charge slightly higher fees on the invoice payments that come in late. Also, since the factoring is not considered a loan, it will not affect your debt utilization or debt-to-equity ratio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Invoice factoring is a form of alternative financing that involves selling your outstanding invoices to a third party (factoring company) in exchange for cash up front. Because it’s a sale, not a loan, it doesn’t impact your credit like traditional bank financing.
