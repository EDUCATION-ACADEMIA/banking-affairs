<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With an overdraft account, a bank is covering payments a customer has made that would otherwise be rejected, or in the case of actual physical checks, would bounce and be returned without payment.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The legal relationship between a customer and the bank is based on contract and is generally classified as a debtor-creditor relationship. This means that when a bank or other type of ADI accepts money from a customer it does so as a borrower on terms that may be implied.
