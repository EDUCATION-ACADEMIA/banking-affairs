<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This will shift the AD curve inwards, and there will be a resulting contraction down the AS curve. Both price level and real GDP will fall. So, an increase in interest rates will-ceteris paribus-cause real GDP to decrease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The fed funds rate impacts how much commercial banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher rate means more expensive borrowing costs, which can reduce demand among banks and other financial institutions to borrow money.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If lower interest rates cause a rise in AD, then it will lead to an increase in real GDP (higher rate of economic growth) and an increase in the inflation rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One fundamental driver of r* is the potential growth rate of the economy: in a high-growth economy, it takes a higher real interest rate to encourage the volume of saving required for the high investment levels needed to sustain a fast-growing economy.
