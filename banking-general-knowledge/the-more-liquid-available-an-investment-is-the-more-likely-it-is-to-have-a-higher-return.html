<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Liquidity describes your ability to exchange an asset for cash. The easier it is to convert an asset into cash, the more liquid it is. And cash is generally considered the most liquid asset. Cash in a bank account or credit union account can be accessed quickly and easily, via a bank transfer or an ATM withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Liquidity affects the value of an investment. You expect to receive a higher return if you give up the ability to cash in your investment quickly. Highly liquid investments therefore can charge a higher price than similar investments that are less liquid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cash is the most liquid asset followed by cash equivalents, which are things like money markets, CDs, or time deposits. Marketable securities such as stocks and bonds listed on exchanges are often very liquid and can be sold quickly via a broker. Gold coins and certain collectibles may also be readily sold for cash.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A company’s liquidity indicates its ability to pay debt obligations, or current liabilities, without having to raise external capital or take out loans. High liquidity means that a company can easily meet its short-term debts while low liquidity implies the opposite and that a company could imminently face bankruptcy.
