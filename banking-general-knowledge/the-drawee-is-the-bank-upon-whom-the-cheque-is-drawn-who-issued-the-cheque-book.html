<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-There are three parties involved in the processing of a cheque: the drawer, who issues the cheque and holds the bank account; the drawee, which is the financial institution; and the payee, who is the person whose name appears on the cheque and will receive the funds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The maker of a bill of exchange or cheque is called the “drawer"; the person thereby directed to pay is called the “drawee".
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A drawee refers to the person or organization that accepts and pays a certain sum of money to a payee. The drawee typically acts as a go-between, redirecting funds from the payer’s account to the payee’s account. The drawee is usually a bank but check-cashing companies and even retail stores can also act as drawees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A bank is the issuer of these types of cheques. The bank issues these cheques on behalf of an account holder to make a remittance to another person in the same city. Here the specified amount is debited from the account of the customer, and then, the cheque is issued by the bank.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
