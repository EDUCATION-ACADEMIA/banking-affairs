<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When you write a check to “Cash” or leave the payee line blank, you have essentially created a pile of cash for anyone to spend, leaving you no recourse after the fact. Since you don’t specify WHO gets the money, ANYONE can take it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-On the line below “Pay to the order of, ” write out the dollar amount in words to match the numerical dollar amount you wrote in the box. For example, if you are paying $130.45, you will write “one hundred thirty and 45/100.” To write a check with cents, be sure to put the cents amount over 100.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The first is in the box in the middle of the right-hand side, just after the recipient’s name, where you’ll write the amount numerically (e.g., “$50.50”). The second is on the long line below the recipient’s name, where you’ll write out the amount in words (e.g., “Fifty and fifty cents” or “Fifty and 50/100”).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Do I have to write out the numbers on a check? While it’s not technically required that you fill out the numeral and written portions of the amounts on your check, the written amount serves as a verification for the bank and helps ensure that your deposit is accurate.
