</div>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The ratio of these liquid assets to the demand and time liabilities is called the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the authority to increase this ratio by up to 40%. An increase in the ratio constricts the ability of the bank to inject money into the economy.
