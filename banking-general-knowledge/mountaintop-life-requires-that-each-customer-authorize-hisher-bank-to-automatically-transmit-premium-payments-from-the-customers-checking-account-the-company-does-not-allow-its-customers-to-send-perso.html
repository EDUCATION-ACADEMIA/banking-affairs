<strong> Mountaintop Life requires that each customer authorize his/her bank to automatically transmit premium payments from the customer’s checking account. The company does not allow its customers to send personal checks. One DISADVANTAGE of this practice is that 
</strong>
<p>(A) Mountaintop must wait until after the policy period has expired to collect premiums from those it insures. 
</p>
<p>(B) the company will have no record of the insurer’s signature if it does not receive checks for premium payments. 
</p>
<p>(C) most states do not allow insurance premiums to be paid through automatic debits, so Mountaintop will only be able to sell insurance in a few states. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** those without checking accounts, but who would otherwise pay through such safe payment mechanisms as money orders and certified checks, cannot purchase insurance from Mountaintop.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT), the general public, government agencies, and business and institutions can pay and collect money electronically, without having to use paper checks.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Using Mobile number &amp; MMID (P2P) IMPS offer an instant, 24*7 interbank electronic fund transfer service capable of processing person to person, person to account and person to merchant remittances via mobile, internet and atms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A standing order is an instruction your customer gives to their bank to pay you a fixed amount at regular intervals whether this is weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A savings account is a basic account in a bank where you can deposit your extra income while gaining interest on the same depending on the saving account interest rate.
