<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The current account measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country. The country runs into a deficit if the value of goods and services we import exceeds the value of those we export.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A deficit then means that the country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting-although the current account also includes net income (such as interest and dividends) and transfers from abroad (such as foreign aid), which are usually a small fraction of the total.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If exports exceed imports then the country has a trade surplus and the trade balance is said to be positive. If imports exceed exports, the country or area has a trade deficit and its trade balance is said to be negative.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If the value of exports exceeds the value of imports, it is said that there is a trade surplus; if imports are greater than exports, the country has a trade deficit.
