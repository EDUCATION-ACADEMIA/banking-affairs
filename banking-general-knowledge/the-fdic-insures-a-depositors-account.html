<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The standard deposit insurance amount is $250, 000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC insures deposits that a person holds in one insured bank separately from any deposits that the person owns in another separately chartered insured bank.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-FDIC insurance safeguards your money at any FDIC-insured bank in case that bank fails. The insurance covers up to $250, 000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. If you opened a savings account with $125, 000 and then you made $25, 000 in interest then you would be insured for $150, 000.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:

So if you keep more than $250, 000 in cash at a single bank, then you run the risk of losing some of those funds if your bank fails. The good news is that bank failures are generally rare; there were only four bank failures in 2020.
