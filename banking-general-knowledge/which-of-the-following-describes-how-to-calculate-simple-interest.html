<title>Which of the following describes how to calculate simple interest?

<meta name="description" content="Simple Interest is calculated using the following formula: SI = P × R × T, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest, and T = Time period. Here, the rate is given in percentage (r%) is written as r/100. And the principal is the sum of money that remains constant for every year in the case of simple interest.To calculate simple interest, multiply the principal amount by the interest rate and the time. The formula written out is Simple Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Time. This equation is the simplest way of calculating interest.The simple interest formula is given by I = PRt where I = interest, P = principal, R = rate, and t = time. Here, I = 10, 000 * 0.09 * 5 = $4, 500. The total repayment amount is the interest plus the principal, so $4, 500 + $10, 000 = $14, 500 total repayment.The simple interest formula states that interest is equal to the principal times the rate times the time. Interest lets you gain value over time. I=PRT.Principal: The principal is the original amount borrowed for a loan or the original amount invested. Interest rate: The interest rate is the proportion of the principal that is added to the principal at each time period. This time period must be the same unit of time as the time period used to calculate t.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Simple Interest is calculated using the following formula: SI = P × R × T, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest, and T = Time period. Here, the rate is given in percentage (r%) is written as r/100. And the principal is the sum of money that remains constant for every year in the case of simple interest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To calculate simple interest, multiply the principal amount by the interest rate and the time. The formula written out is “Simple Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Time.” This equation is the simplest way of calculating interest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The simple interest formula is given by I = PRt where I = interest, P = principal, R = rate, and t = time. Here, I = 10, 000 * 0.09 * 5 = $4, 500. The total repayment amount is the interest plus the principal, so $4, 500 + $10, 000 = $14, 500 total repayment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The simple interest formula states that interest is equal to the principal times the rate times the time. Interest lets you gain value over time. I=PRT.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Principal: The principal is the original amount borrowed for a loan or the original amount invested. Interest rate: The interest rate is the proportion of the principal that is added to the principal at each time period. This time period must be the same unit of time as the time period used to calculate t.
