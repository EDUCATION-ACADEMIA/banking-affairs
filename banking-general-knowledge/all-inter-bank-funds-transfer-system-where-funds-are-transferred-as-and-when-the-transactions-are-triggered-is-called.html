<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The acronym ‘RTGS’ stands for Real Time Gross Settlement, which can be explained as a system where there is continuous and real-time settlement of fund-transfers, individually on a transaction-by-transaction basis (without netting).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An RTGS system is a gross settlement system in which both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions can take place continuously (i.e., in real time). 4 As it is a gross settlement system, transfers are settled individually, i.e., without netting debits against credits.
