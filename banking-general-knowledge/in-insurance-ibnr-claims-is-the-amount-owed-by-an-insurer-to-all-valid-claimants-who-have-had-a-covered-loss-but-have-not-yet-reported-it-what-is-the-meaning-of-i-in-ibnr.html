<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Incurred but not reported (IBNR) is a type of reserve account used in the insurance industry as the provision for claims and/or events that have transpired, but have not yet been reported to an insurance company.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-IBNR stands for Incurred But Not Reported, which refers to the estimate of the liability from claims that have taken place but have not yet been reported to an insurer.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The total cost is the claims already paid out plus the incurred but not paid claims, so add these together and divide by the number of members active at each month for which the claims are incurred to calculate the average cost per enrollee per month. The calculations are done in the “Enrollment Data” tab.
</p>
<p>
