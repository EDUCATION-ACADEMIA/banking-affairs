<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The money multiplier is 1/0.15=6.6667. The total effect of a $40 billion increase in reserves on checkable deposits is the size of the increase multiplied by the money multiplier which is $40*6.6667=$267 billion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Excess Reserves = Total Reserves-Required Reserves For example, suppose a bank has $20 million in deposits. If its reserve ratio is 10%, then it’s required to keep at least $2 million on hand. However, if the bank has $3 million in reserves, then $1 million of it is in excess reserves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-the excess reserves of member banks are reduced. Refer to the given balance sheets. If the reserve ratio is 25 percent, commercial banks have excess reserves of: $12.
