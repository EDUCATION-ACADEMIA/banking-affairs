<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Try a simple budgeting plan. We recommend the popular 50/30/20 budget to maximize your money. In it, you spend roughly 50% of your after-tax dollars on necessities, no more than 30% on wants, and at least 20% on savings and debt repayment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Spending includes everything you spend your money on; all of what you may typically think of as “expenses” (utility bills, groceries, transportation costs), but savings for a rainy day, debt payments, life insurance premiums and RRSP contributions are all expenses as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Needs are those bills that you absolutely must pay and are the things necessary for survival. These expenses can include rent or mortgage payments, car payments, groceries, insurance, health care, minimum debt payment, and utilities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This probably goes without saying, if you have a true emergency then you should use your savings. That is the purpose of the emergency fund. So if your car suddenly threatens to quit on you and you need it for your job, that’s an emergency. If you have a sudden medical bill, that is an emergency.
