<meta name="description" content="Repo rate refers to the rate at which commercial banks borrow money by selling their securities to the Central Bank of our country i.e. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to maintain liquidity, in case of shortage of funds or due to some statutory measures.

On the other hand, it is slashed if the country is headed towards deflation. How does the repo rate impact inflation? A hike in the repo rate increases the interest rate to be paid by the commercial banks on loans from the RBI.Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 per cent.
