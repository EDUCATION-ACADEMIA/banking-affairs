<meta name="description" content="APR, which stands for annual percentage rate, is the yearly cost of borrowing money.

Then multiply $500 x 0.0149 for an amount of $7.45 each month.If your issuer uses a daily balance, youll divide the APR by 365 days. If the APR is compounded monthly, divide it by 12 months.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-APR, which stands for annual percentage rate, is the yearly cost of borrowing money. If you borrow $1, 000 for a year at a 20% APR, the total to pay back would be $1, 200.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-For example, if you currently owe $500 on your credit card throughout the month and your current APR is 17.99%, you can calculate your monthly interest rate by dividing the 17.99% by 12, which is approximately 1.49%. Then multiply $500 x 0.0149 for an amount of $7.45 each month.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If your issuer uses a daily balance, you’ll divide the APR by 365 days. If the APR is compounded monthly, divide it by 12 months. For example, an APR of 14.99% compounded daily would have a periodic rate of (14.99% / 365) = 0.00041, or 0.041%.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A 22% APR means that the credit card’s balance will increase by approximately 22% over the course of a year if the cardholder carries a balance the whole time. For example, if the APR is 22% and you carry a $1, 000 balance for a year, you would owe around $216.99 in interest by the end of that year.
